    <h1>About me</h1>
    <img id="tina" src="./Images/IMG_20180316_131653 (1).jpg">
    <p id="owner">I am a 5 generation homestead owner from Colorado and currently a new breeder. I have always owned and
        loved dogs and horses as they have always been my passion, but it wasn't until the later chapter of my life did
        I decide to raise and breed French Bulldogs.</p>
    <p id="owner">I make sure that all my dogs are adopted out to good homes with a $500.00 USD deposit to hold till they're of
        age at 8 weeks old and weaned. They're always vet checked and first shots ready before they're allowed to leave
        to their forever homes. </p>
    <p id="owner">Please contact me if you're interested in one of my puppies, you can contact me through the Contact Us
        page or my facebook page.</p>
